    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      	Depeche Mode are an English electronic music band formed in Basildon, Essex in 1980. 
	      The group as of now consists of a trio.

	      Depeche Mode released their debut album Speak & Spell in 1981, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. 
	      They recorded A Broken Frame as a trio. Gore took over as main songwriter and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder replaced Clarke, 
	      establishing a lineup that continued for 13 years.
        The band's last albums of the 1980s, Black Celebration and Music for the Masses, established them as a dominant force within 
	      the electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's June 1988 concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew 
	      a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In early 1990, they released Violator, an international mainstream success. 
	      The following album, Songs of Faith and Devotion in 1993 was also a success, though internal struggles within the band during 
	      recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995.

	      Depeche Mode has had 54 songs in the UK Singles Chart and 17 top 10 albums in the UK chart; they have sold more than 100 million records worldwide
